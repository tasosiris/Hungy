A mobile "rapid" order app!

An idea that I came up with in quarantine(May 2020). It's an app that has a QR code scanner and a menu of a restaurant! Every table in the restaurant is supposed to have a unique QR code printed in the corner. A customer can scan the QR code and make an order without calling a waiter. I never got the time to finish the project because I had a lot of homework!
